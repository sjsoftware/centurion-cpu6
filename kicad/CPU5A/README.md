# CPU 5 Reverse Engineering

Use at your own risk

I've included board layouts. If you're going to use them note the following:
* Before getting the boards made, ensure that the interboard connections actually align
    * Currentlty there is the A revision which is based off the board images
    * When new revisions arrive, they are intended to be used as a pair, don't mix them
* Making these is complex and involves a lot of soldering
    * Start with the interboard connections
    * Make sure power and ground are where you expect
    * Put in the passives
    * I haven't designed the breakout boards for the page table/registers yet - you're on your own
    * That's about as far as I've got

I'm planning to design several versions of these, but it's not going to happen quickly
